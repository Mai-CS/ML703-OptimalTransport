## Abstract
Effective prediction of acute respiratory failure is critical for proactive healthcare management. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide rich patient information that can aid in prediction, but the imbalanced class distribution poses a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel approach that uses optimal transport (OT) for imbalanced classification of EHRs, combined with multimodality fusion. Specifically, we leverage multiple modalities of patient data, including clinical notes, demographics, vital signs, and laboratory results, to provide a comprehensive view of a patient's health status. Results show that our approach significantly improves prediction performance by leveraging the OT framework, which optimally matches the probability distributions of the imbalanced classes.
